# Web-Scraping-HTML-Tables

## Introduction
As an aspiring data scientist, I do a lot of projects which involve scraping data from various websites. Some companies like Twitter do provide APIs to get their information in a more organized way while we have to scrape other websites to get data in a structured format.

The general idea behind web scraping is to retrieve data that exists on a website and convert it into a format that is usable for analysis. In this repository, I will reveal my technique by showing 2 concrete examples in Python using the package `BeautifulSoup`.
